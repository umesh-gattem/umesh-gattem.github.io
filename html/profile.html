                <p>Hi, I'm Umesh Kumar an enthusiastic coder and designer passionate about learning new technologies
                    and its applications. I have always been fascinated by Coding, Mathematics, Algorithms.
                    My keen interest in Mathematics made me one among the toppers of my class during my Secondary
                    Education.
                    I have participated in so many Maths Olympiad Examinations and got some scholarships.
                    Later I joined M.P.C (Maths, Physics, Chemistry) group in my Intermediate Studies and then by
                    giving a common entrance examination, EAMCET (Engineering Agricultural and Medical Common Entrance
                    Test)
                    where I got a good rank and secured a seat in the “Computer Science Engineering” department in
                    prestigious Anil Neerukonda Institute of Technology and Science College,
                    affiliated to Andhra University, Visakhapatnam, India. </p><br>
                <p>
                    In four years of my Bachelor’s degree, I acquired an overall perspective of this scientific
                    discipline,
                    with a particular interest in Coding and Programming, Object-Oriented Programming concepts
                    Database Management, Data Structures, etc. I have participated in so many online Coding competitions
                    like CodeChef, Hackerank and I really enjoy the delightful feeling I get after solving a difficult
                    problem. I have been awarded 3rd prize in “Code Drift”, a coding competition held at our
                    institution.
                    For my final year dissertation, I have worked on the project “Dynamic Resource Allocation using
                    Virtual Machine Migration in IaaS” leading a team of four members. As part of my Summer Internship,
                    I have worked on “Android Application” on my college database which consists of features like
                    attendance of students, faculty details, library details, transportation facilities leading a team
                    of four members. Till then my coding had been largely restricted to basic C++, these projects have
                    forced me to work on Java, HTML, CSS and I readily accepted it.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    With a solid foundation in the field of computer science, I have attempted and cleared so many
                    interviews and placed in Infosys Private Limited and Capgemini companies. But with the interest in
                    Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, I have searched for AI startup companies. Finally, in
                    July 2016 I joined Razorthink Technologies Private Limited which is one of the top AI startup
                    companies
                    in India. I joined as a python software developer and later moved to the Deep Learning team where
                    I started working on Tensorflow. In these three years, I have been part of the Razorthink AI(RZTAI)
                    platform product team which builds AI solutions for the end-users. I am one of the four developers
                    who contributed deep learning capabilities to the RZTAI platform. We have built a deep learning
                    Framework called Razorthink Deep Learning(RZTDL) which is built on top of Tensorflow, consisting of
                    API’s for training, inferring deep learning models. I have been a major contributor to the RZTDL
                    framework where I implemented several Tensorflow operations like Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN’s),
                    Feed-Forward Networks, etc. During my work experience, I have gone through some research papers like
                    “A Style based generator architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks'', which propose an
                    alternative generator architecture for GAN’s, borrowing from style transfer literature,
                    “A probe towards understanding of GAN and VAE models”, which compares Vanilla Gan, Wasserstein GAN
                    and Variational Autoencoders, “Self Normalizing Neural Networks(SNN)”, “Adaptive Structure
                    Learning of Artificial Neural Networks”, which presents new algorithms for adaptively learning
                    artificial neural networks and etc.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Being working as an AI Engineer, I have a better understanding of Deep Learning, Neural Networks,
                    and AI Frameworks. With the keen interest on Research and Data Science technologies I decided to do
                    my
                    Master's in the Artificial Intelligence or Data Science field to enhance my skills.
                    I got an offer from “Indiana University Bloomington(IUB)” which is one of the top
                    universities in the United States and is a community-engaged university.
                    Indiana University Bloomington is the flagship campus of IU's eight campuses, known for its
                    innovation, creativity, and academic freedom. Currently I'm pursuing my Master's degree in Data
                    Science
                    Program at IUB.
